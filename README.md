# Album API

The goal of this project was to build a minimal web API using the ASP.NET 7 framework in C#. This API performs CRUD operations through HTTP request methods, including GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 

Although this is a minimalistic API, an important aspect I focused on during development was being consistent in my application of good coding practices and real-world concepts, including: 

### Model-View-Controller Architecture

### Dependency Injection

### Data Transfer Objects

### Asynchronous Calls


# About

I ultimately chose ASP.NET 7 over Spring because of the Entity Framework Core + C#'s LINQ syntax.

This project is developed fully by Alex Taveras-Crespo.
